# Blender-Python-Package-Manager

Features:
1. pip installation (if not already present). 
2. List all python packages within Blender's bundled python and view their installed versions.
3. Manage multiple packages. 
4. Auto-update packages.
5. Search and Install packages from package name, requirements file, setup.py file or from github repository.
